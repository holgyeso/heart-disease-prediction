# Heart Disease Prediction
The aim of the project is to build a Django web application for a previously trained and saved machine learning model.
The algorithm predicts based on 17 normalized/standardized features whether the patient has heart disease or not.

## Data Source

The dataset is based on the 2020 annual CDC survey data of 400k U.S. adults related to their health status. 17 questions were selected for this dataset (from the 250+ questions asked) that have quantitative and qualitative nature as well.
